# Agency landing page
This project was created based on a Frontend Mentor [https://www.frontendmentor.io/] challenge. The layout and design idea come from Frontend Mentor, while the code implementation is my own.

## 📦 Technologies
- HTML5 (semantic structure)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, custom variables, media queries)
- Vanilla JavaScript (mobile navigation toggle)
- Responsive layout and adaptive images
- Google Fonts & custom fonts via @font-face

## 📚 What I Learned
- Building my first responsive landing page from scratch
- Creating a mobile burger menu using JavaScript
- Using CSS variables for consistent colors and styling
- Working with CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Implementing responsive images with the <picture> element

## 🚀 How It Can Be Improved?
